      <h3>Updated System Requirements</h3>
      <p>The system requirements for Brightcove Player 7 are as follows:</p>
      <table class="bcls-table">
        <thead class="bcls-table__head">
          <tr>
            <th>Browser/Engine</th>
            <th>Platforms/OS</th>
            <th>Minimum Version</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
          <tr>
            <td>Chrome</td>
            <td>Windows, macOS, Android, iPadOS <sup><a href="#n1"> [1]</a></sup>, iOS <sup><a href="#n1"> [1]</a></sup></td>
            <td>Current and two previous major versions</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Edge</td>
            <td>Windows, macOS, Android, iPadOS <sup><a href="#n1"> [1]</a></sup>, iOS <sup><a href="#n1"> [1]</a></sup></td>
            <td>Current and two previous major versions</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Firefox</td>
            <td>Windows, macOS, Android, iPadOS <sup><a href="#n1"> [1]</a></sup>, iOS <sup><a href="#n1"> [1]</a></sup></td>
            <td>Current and two previous major versions</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Safari</td>
            <td>macOS, iPadOS, iOS</td>
            <td>Current and two previous major versions</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The following notes refer to table above.</p>
      <p id="n1"><sup>[1]</sup> On iPadOS and iOS, only the Safari browser engine is allowed. Alternative browsers, like Chrome and Firefox and Edge, use Safari under the hood. Their behavior will not match the real versions of those browsers.</p>

      <h3>Internet Explorer 11</h3>
      <p>As of June 15th, 2021 and Brightcove Player 6.56.0, we stopped officially supporting IE11. After this point, we made efforts to not actively break in the IE browser. This is not the case with player 7.</p>
      <p>With Brightcove Player 7.0.0, we removed all code for supporting IE11, and the player will not function in IE.</p>
      <p>If a viewer tries playback in IE, the player detects Internet Explorer and displays an "unsupported browser" message.</p>

      <p>Each section below, representing a change, has a bracketed abbreviation that indicates which major component(s) were impacted:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>BCP7</strong>: This change applies to Brightcove Player 7</li>
        <li><strong>VJS8</strong>: This change applies to Video.js 8</li>
        <li><strong>VHS3</strong>: This change applies to Video.js HTTP Streaming 3</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>What this Guide Does Not Cover</h3>
      <p>It should be noted that this guide covers only the user-facing changes to the Brightcove Player 7.</p>
      <p>It does not cover the significant internal changes related to code organization to make future development of the Player easier for our engineers. We are extremely proud of the fact that Brightcove Player remains the industry-leading web video player even after almost a decade of continuous development.</p>

    <section class="bcls-section">
      <h2 id="Features_and_Enhancements">Features and Enhancements</h2>
      <p>Features and enhancements refer to net new features of the player or significantly changed or improved features and behaviors.</p>

      <h3>ES6 By Default</h3>
      <p>Change applies to VJS8,VHS3,BCP7</p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">Migration may be needed if your integration code is extending Video.js classes.</aside>
      <p>Most of Brightcove Player 7 is no longer transpiled into ES5 code - including Video.js and VHS.</p>
      <p>Most code is now transpiled to target <a href="#Browser_and_Device_Support">modern browser engines</a>. One of the nice outcomes of this is that we were able to reduce the overall packaged size of our code by 3-5%.</p>
      <h4>Migration Considerations</h4>
      <p>Code that attempts to inherit native ES6 classes, but is ultimately transpiled to ES5 will no longer work with Video.js 8 and Brightcove Player 7. This incompatibility will generally be surfaced by an error being thrown with a message like:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">TypeError: Class constructor ___ cannot be invoked without &apos;new&apos;
</code></pre>
      <p>This is because transpilation tools like Babel will convert classes into plain JavaScript functions and attempt to call <code translate="No">apply()</code> or <code translate="No">call()</code> on them. These methods exist on functions, but not ES6 classes.</p>
      <p>The only solution is to not transpile ES6 classes to ES5 for use with Video.js 8 and Brightcove Player 7.</p>

      <h3>Viewability Events and Behaviors</h3>
      <p>Change applies to BCP7</p>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">New feature, no migration necessary!</aside>
      <p>The viewability of a player is of real importance to advertising integrations as well as some UI treatments like floating players. In this context, we are defining “viewability” as the percentage of a player that is visible in the browser viewport at any given moment. A player is considered “viewable” if some specific percentage of the player is in the viewport.</p>
      <p>Brightcove Player 7 introduces viewability tracking DOM events as well as some useful behaviors that depend on the player’s viewable state.</p>
      <h4>Viewability Configuration</h4>
      <p>The player's viewability events and behavior can be configured in your player's JSON configuration. All configurations are available under the <code translate="No">viewability</code> property.</p>
      <table class="bcls-table">
        <thead class="bcls-table__head">
          <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Default</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody class="bcls-table__body">
          <tr>
            <td><code translate="No">viewability_threshold</code></td>
            <td>A number between <code translate="No">0</code> and <code translate="No">1</code> representing the portion of the player that must be in the viewport for it to count as "viewable".</td>
            <td><code translate="No">number</code></td>
            <td><code translate="No">0.6</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code translate="No">min_duration_for_viewable_impression</code></td>
            <td>Represents the number of milliseconds to wait after ad playback begins before testing for a viewable impression.<br/><br/> 
              By default, this means that the player will report whether the ad impression was viewable using a <code translate="No">viewable-ad-impression</code> event after 2 seconds of ad playback.</td>
            <td><code translate="No">number</code></td>
            <td><code translate="No">2000</code></td>

            <td><code translate="No">threshold_percentage_increment</code></td>
            <td>The amount of viewability change required between <code translate="No">viewable-percent-change</code> events.<br/><br/>
              By default, the value <code translate="No">5</code> means that <code translate="No">viewable-percent-change</code> events will only fire if the viewability of the player has changed by 5% (e.g. from 45% to 50%).<br/><br/>
              It is recommended not to go any more granular with this as it will fire a lot of events..</td>
            <td><code translate="No">number</code></td>
            <td><code translate="No">5</code></td>
          </tr>

            <td><code translate="No">delay_autoplay_if_not_viewable</code></td>
            <td>Only interacts with players that are configured for autoplay.<br/><br/>
              If <code translate="No">true</code>, the player delays its playback attempt until the player is viewable.<br/><br/>
              If <code translate="No">false</code>, the player will attempt playback regardless of its viewability state. This is the default behavior of an autoplay player..</td>
            <td><code translate="No">boolean</code></td>
            <td><code translate="No">false</code></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code translate="No">delay_autoplay_on_mobile_only</code></td>
            <td>If <code translate="No">true</code>, the delay autoplay feature will only be activated on mobile environments (iOS or Android).<br/><br/>
              <strong>NOTE</strong>: In this case, tablets are considered mobile environments..</td>
            <td><code translate="No">boolean</code></td>

          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><code translate="No">pause_when_not_viewable</code></td>
            <td>If <code translate="No">true</code>, the player will pause playback if it becomes not viewable. When the player becomes viewable again, playback will resume.<br/><br/>
              If <code translate="No">false</code>, the player will not toggle pause or play on <code translate="No">viewable-change</code>. This is the default behavior of a player..</td>
            <td><code translate="No">boolean</code></td>
            <td><code translate="No">false</code></td>
