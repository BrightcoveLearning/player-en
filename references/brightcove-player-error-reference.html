      each type, if applicable.

      Very generally, media errors occur when issues arise trying to retrieve or
      playback the media. For instance, if your network connection is lost, or
      you get an encrypted video that cannot be decrypted, you will get a media
      error. For complete details see the

      player exists, to retrieve a video you will get a catalog error. For

            some media events will be incorrect. For more information, see

            You see this because for the IMA3 plugin to function properly it
            needs to be loaded right after player initialization, before any
