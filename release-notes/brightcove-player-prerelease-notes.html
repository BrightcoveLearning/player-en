    Note that every 1-2 weeks pre-released versions become the current version. At that time all non-locked players are upgraded to the current version. If you wish to lock your player on a certain version for some reason, see the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/players/setting-player-update-mode-and-version.html">opting out of automatic player updates (external site)</a>.

    <h2>Try new version</h2>

    <p>
      If a pre-release version is available, the easiest way to try out a pre-release version is to go to Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module, click on the player you wish to change, and then edit the <strong>Player Information</strong> . Use the version selector to choose the latest pre-release:
    </p>

    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" alt="select player version" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/release-info/pre-release/select-player-version.png" />
    </figure>

    <p>
      You can update a player to the pre-release version by using a curl statement. A quick overview of curl can be found at the top of the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/getting-started/step-step-player-management.html">Step-by-Step: Player Management (external site)</a>. In the document there is a specific section on how to <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/getting-started/step-step-player-management.html#updatePlayer">update your player</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the curl command to update your player, where you substitute appropriate values for <strong>YOUR_EMAIL</strong> , <strong>YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID</strong>, <strong>YOUR_PLAYER_ID</strong> and the latest pre-release version numbers for <strong>X.X.X</strong>.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-bash" translate="No">curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{
    "player": {
    "template": {
      "version": "X.X.X"
      }
    }
  }' \
  https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/configuration
</code>
</pre>

    <p>
      In most cases you will want to publish the player, which can be done with the following curl statement. Again, you will need to substitute correct values where indicated.
    </p>

    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-bash" translate="No">curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user YOUR_EMAIL  \
  --request POST \
  https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/YOUR_ACCOUNT/players/YOUR_PLAYER_ID/publish
