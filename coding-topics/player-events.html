    <p>The Brightcove Player has many events for you to control video playback. This topic provides an overview about the different types of events.</p>
    <p>A complete list of Brightcove Player events can be found in the <a href="https://docs.brightcove.com/brightcove-player/current-release/Player.html#toc120__anchor">Player Methods/Events API</a> reference document. This document reflects the events that are part of the actual code that makes up the player.</p>

    <h2 id="mediaevents">Media events</h2>
    <p>The <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">HTML Living Standard</a> document is a great resource for information about the development of HTML and the APIs needed for web applications. This is a "living" document that is kept current by the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which is a growing community of people interested in evolving the web.</p>
    <p>The Brightcove Player runs on top of the HTML framework, which triggers the following <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#mediaevents">Media Events</a>.</p>
    <p>Here are some terms associated with events in this document:</p>
    <h3>blocked</h3>
    <p>A MediaController is considered blocked if playback has been <a href="//dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/media-elements.html#paused-media-controller">paused</a>. A media element is blocked if its controller is a <a href="//dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/media-elements.html#blocked-media-controller">blocked media controller</a>.</p>
    <h3>MediaController</h3>
    <p>A <a href="//dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/media-elements.html#mediacontroller">MediaController</a> is an object that coordinates the playback of multiple media elements.</p>
    <h3>media element</h3>
    <p>A <a href="//dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/media-elements.html#media-element">media element</a> presents audio data, or video and audio data, to the user.</p>
    <h3>slaved</h3>
    <p>By default each media element has no <code translate="No">MediaController</code>. When media elements are associated with a <code translate="No">MediaController</code>, they are said to be <a href="//dev.w3.org/html5/spec-preview/media-elements.html#slaved-media-elements">slaved</a> to the controller. The controller modifies the playback rate and volume of each of the media elements slaved to it. If one of the slaved elements stalls unexpectedly, the controller will stop the other slaved elements.</p>

    <h2 id="bufferingandqosevents">Buffering and QoS events</h2>
    <p>Here is a subset of events related to buffering and quality of service (QoS):</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">

    <h2 id="startupevents">Startup events</h2>
    <p>There are a number of events that occur when the player is initialized and prepares to play a video. They are listed here in the order they will be dispatched:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code translate="No">loadstart</code>: Dispatched when the player is initialized, and if itâ€™s re-initialized in the case of giving it a new source to play</p>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">Since the <code translate="No">loadstart</code> event may happen before the player is ready, it is best practice to set the event listener for this event before calling the player's <code translate="No">ready()</code> function. See the CodePen below.</aside>
      </li>
      <li><code translate="No">loadedmetadata</code>: Dispatched when the player has initial duration and dimension information, in other words, when the first segment is downloaded. For live videos the <code translate="No">loadedmetadata</code> event won't be dispatched until the user clicks play. This is because live videos don't start downloading segments until the user clicks play.</li>
      <li><code translate="No">loadeddata</code>: Dispatched when the player has downloaded data at the current playback position</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following CodePen shows the startup events being listened for and dispatched. Note that if you mouse over the CodePen, you can click the <strong>RERUN</strong> button located in the bottom-right to see the events dispatch again. If you wish to experiment with the code, click the <strong>Edit on CODEPEN</strong> link in the header to move to the editing environment. You can click the <strong>JS</strong> button to see the JavaScript that add the event listeners.</p>
    <p data-height="400" data-theme-id="14832" data-slug-hash="jPrdQm" data-default-tab="result" data-user="bcls" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/team/bcls/pen/jPrdQm/">Startup Events Demo</a> by Brightcove Learning Services (<a href="https://codepen.io/team/rcrooks1969">@bcls</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>
    <script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: It may be possible on first load of this page you will not see the <code translate="No">loadstart</code> event. This is because that event could be dispatched before the CodePen is fully rendered on the page. Click the <strong>RERUN</strong> button and you will see all three events dispatched.</aside>
    <h3>ready() method</h3>
    <p>The <code translate="No">ready()</code> method has a dual personality in that it seems like an event, but you use it like a method. This method/event means the player is ready to receive commands.</p>
    <p>The <code translate="No">ready()</code> method differs from event listeners in that if the <code translate="No">ready</code> event has already happened it will trigger the <code translate="No">ready()</code> method immediately. You will often see the method used as follows to provide the starting point for development with Brightcove Player:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function(){
  var myPlayer = this;
});</code></pre>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">Note: It is important to realize that if the player has to switch playback technologies, say from HTML to Flash, to play a video the <code translate="No">ready</code> method/event event handlers will rerun once the new playback tech is up and running.</aside>
    <h3>ready() vs. on('loadedmetadata',...)</h3>
    <p>Note that using <code translate="No">ready()</code> functions correctly if you wish to interact with the player, for instance programmatically add a plugin. If you wish to immediately interact with the video, for instance use <code translate="No">play()</code>, the code snippet above will not always work correctly. A better approach would be to listen for the <code translate="No">loadedmetadata</code> to interact with the video, for instance:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').on('loadedmetadata',function(){
  var myPlayer = this;
  myPlayer.play();
});</code></pre>
    <p>In summary, to interact with the player you can use this:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready()</code></pre>
    <p>If you wish to immediately interact with the video in the player use this:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').on('loadedmetadata',function(){})</code></pre>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The reason you must wait for the <code translate="No">loadedmetadata</code> event to be dispatched is that it ensures the catalog has had time to retrieve the video before it tries to play.</aside>
  </section>
  <section id="fullscreenEvents">
    <h2 class="bcls-section">Fullscreen events</h2>
    <p>A <code translate="No">fullscreenchange</code> event is emitted by the player when it is toggled to or from fullscreen mode. The same event is broadcast whether the player is going to fullscreen or returning to normal mode, If it is important for you to know which happened, use the <code translate="No">player.isFullscreen()</code> method to determine whether the player is currently in fullscreen mode.</p>
    <p>The Codepen below illustrates how to do this.</p>
    <p data-height="766" data-theme-id="14832" data-slug-hash="JGEdEd" data-default-tab="result" data-user="bcls" class="codepen">See the Pen <a href="http://codepen.io/team/bcls/pen/JGEdEd/">Brightcove Player Fullscreen Events</a> by Brightcove Learning Services (<a href="http://codepen.io/bcls">@bcls</a>) on <a href="http://codepen.io">CodePen</a>.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="adevents">Ad events</h2>
    <p>To include advertisement libraries and functionality to your player, you can use the <a href="/plugins/advertising-ima3-plugin.html">IMA3 Plugin</a> or the <a href="/plugins/advertising-freewheel-plugin.html">FreeWheel Plugin</a>. This is built on top of the <a href="https://github.com/videojs/videojs-contrib-ads/blob/master/README.md">videojs ads framework</a> (videojs-contrib-ads). Both of these advertising plugins can dispatch the ad events shown in the following table. Each also have specific events particular to the implementation.</p>
    <table class="bcls-table">
      <thead class="bcls-table__head">
        <tr>

  <section id="bc-catalog-error" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>bc-catalog-error event</h2>
    <p>It is possible that handling errors in the normal <code translate="No">ready()</code> section in the script block can cause issues. For instance, it can happen that the <code translate="No">bc-catalog-error</code> event could be dispatched before the player is ready, and if you listen for the error in the <code translate="No">ready()</code> section, you will not be able to handle the error. This issue can occur when using geo-filtering, a video is unpublished, a video is out of scheduling range, or in a different account. For a complete discussion and examples handling the <code translate="No">bc-catalog-error</code> event, see the <a href="/references/player-catalog.html">Player Catalog</a> document.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="progresstimeupdate" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>progress and timeupdate</h2>
    <p>Confusion can occur about the differences between the <code translate="No">progress</code> and <code translate="No">timeupdate</code> events. The Brightcove Player builds on top of HTML5 video, and in that standard the <code translate="No">progress</code> event is dispatched when the browser is downloading data. The <code translate="No">timeupdate</code> event is dispatched when the current playback position has changed.</p>
    <p>This can be confusing to users of Brightcove's Smart Player, as in that API the <code translate="No">progress</code> event does what <code translate="No">timeupdate</code> does in the Brightcove Player API.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="section-name" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Caution removing timeupdate listeners</h2>
    <p>In some cases you might want to remove an event listener you have added to the <code translate="No">timeupdate</code> event. A use case is shown in the <a href="/code-samples/brightcove-player-sample-register-play-after-preview.html">Brightcove Player Sample: Registering to Play after Preview</a> document. In this situation, you want the player to pause in some time range, and you are using <code translate="No">timeupdate</code> for the time check, then use an anonymous event handler function definition. You only want to pause once, so you need to remove the event listener. You do NOT want to simply do:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">myPlayer.off('timeupdate');</code></pre>
    <p>Of course, this removes ALL event listeners to <code translate="No">timeupdate</code>, and among other issues doing this will prevent the time scrubber from advancing. What needs to be done is create a function using normal function definition syntax (a function declaration), then remove JUST the one event listener. The abbreviated code is shown here:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No"> // Add the event handler
myPlayer.on('timeupdate', timeupdateHandler);

// Handle the event then remove JUST this event listener on timeupdate
function timeupdateHandler(evt) {
  ...
  myPlayer.off('timeupdate', timeupdateHandler);
}</code></pre>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="analytics_events">Analytics events</h2>
    <p>An event is triggered each time a beacon is sent to the Analytics data collector. You can listen for any beacon or specific ones.</p>
    <h3>Listen for all beacons</h3>
    <p>You can track all analytics beacons sent by listening for the <code translate="No">analytics_request</code> event:</p>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">player.on('analytics_request', function(e) {
  videojs.log('sent a(n) ' + e.params.event + ' beacon!', e.params);
});</code></pre>
    <h3>Listen for specific beacons</h3>
    <p>You can track specific analytics beacons sent by listening for the <code translate="No">analytics_request_<span class="bcls-input">{beacon_name}</span></code> event.</p>
    <p><code translate="No">{beacon_name}</code> is the name of any of the player events that are sent to the data collector. For a complete list of these events, see the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/data-collection/references/reference.html#tag/Events">Data Collection API Reference</a>.</p>
    <h4>Example</h4>
<pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">player.on('analytics_request_video_impression', function(e) {
  videojs.log('sent an impression beacon!', e.params);
});</code></pre>
