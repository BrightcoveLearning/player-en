  <h1>Programmatically Localizing Brightcove Player</h1>
  <summary>In this topic you will learn how to localize Brightcove Player. This is, literally, hard to see as the names of the control elements do not appear as you hover over them. The localized names of the control elements would be used by a screen reader though. In this document you will use the player's HTML structure to confirm the elements' names have be localized.</summary>
  <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">You can configure localization using Studio as shown in the <a href="/node/18715">Configuring Player Localization</a> document. Whereas that document uses a UI to configure localization, this document takes a programmatic approach.</aside>

    <h2>Document structure</h2>
    <p>First the process for localizing the In-Page Embed implementation is shown, then the iframe implementation. The document concludes by demonstrating how to edit or add to localized vocabulary if you wish to localize content on the page surrounding the player.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="includelanguage" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Include language(s)</h2>
    <p>The first task for localization is to include the language(s) you wish to use for localization. You can see the languages available at the <a href="//github.com/videojs/video.js/tree/master/lang">Video.js language page</a>, shown here.</p>

    <p>The content of the German (de) file is shown below. The file shows the words/phrases that will be translated automatically.</p>

    <p>Once you have decided on what languages to support for localization, you must configure your player to include them. You do this using the <a href="/node/18269">Player Management API</a>. You could use code patterned on the following curl statement to add language support when creating the player:</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: If you have no experience using curl statements with the Player Management API, it is suggested you begin with the <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/getting-started/step-step-player-management.html">Step-by-Step: Player Management.</a></aside>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user $EMAIL \
  --request POST \
  --data '{
      "name": "Localization Example",
      "configuration": {
<span class="bcls-highlight">        "languages": [
          "de",
          "es"
        ],
</span>        "media": {
          "sources": [{
            "src":"http://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/assets/videos/Tiger.mp4",
            "type":"video/mp4"
          }]
        }
      }
    }' \
    https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players</code></pre>
    <p>If the player already exists, and you wish to add language support, you could use code patterned on the following curl statement to update the player:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-json">curl \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --user $EMAIL \
  --request PATCH \
  --data '{
<span class="bcls-highlight">      "languages": [
        "de",
        "es"
      ]</span>
    }' \
  https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players/$PLAYER_ID/configuration</code></pre>
    Now you'll publish the player to make the changes to the published player. Enter the following command:
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-bash">curl \
--header "Content-Type: application/json" \
--user $EMAIL \
--request POST \
https://players.api.brightcove.com/v2/accounts/$ACCOUNT_ID/players/$PLAYER_ID/publish</code></pre>
    <p>An example player configuration with languages set appears as follows:</p>

  </section>
  <section id="setlanguage" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Set language</h2>
    <p>To use the localized control names, the user can set the preferred language in the browser. The exact steps vary depending on browser and OS (broad guidance is given in the next paragraph). If the browser's preferred language is English, or a language not available, you will see the default, or English, text.</p>
    <p>Browsers do not have perfectly standardized locale detection, so it can be a bit complicated. Broadly, browsers look to determine the desired language in this order:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Check if the embedding page has a <code>lang</code> attribute on the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element.</li>
      <li>Check browser specific locale configurations.</li>
      <li>Fall back to English.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>iframe query parameter</h4>
    <p>If you are using the iframe implementation of the player you can set the language for that player by including a query parameter in the <code>src</code> attribute. Added to the existing query parameter that has the video ID, for instance <code>?videoId=4607746980001</code>, you can set the language using <code>&amp;language=</code> followed by the language code. For example, here is an iframe player implementation setting the language to German:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="iframe localization parameter" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/localization/iframe-language-parameter.png" /></figure>
  </section>
  <section id="results" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>As mentioned in the opening paragraph of this document, the results of a localized player are not easily seen. To check for successful localization you can inspect the big-play-button. Use a browser's debugging tools to inspect the button.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">
      <p>Note: If you are comfortable with jQuery, you can quickly see the localized text by using the browser's Console and the expression <code>$(".vjs-big-play-button").firstChild</code>. You will see <strong>Play Video</strong> has been localized, as shown in this screenshot from the console:</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="inspect play button" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/localization/console-video-abspielen.png" /></figure>
    </aside>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="inspect play button" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/localization/localization-inspect-play-button.png" /></figure>
    <p>Drill down into the HTML until you see the text for the button, which in the non-localized version is <strong>Play Video</strong>.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="english localization" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/localization/localization-english.png" /></figure>
    <p>After following the steps shown above, the player will be localized. In the following screenshot the button is localized for German.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="german localization" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/localization/localization-deutsch.png" /></figure>
  </section>
  <section id="iframeimplementation" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>iframe implementation</h2>
    <p>Localizing the iframe implementation of Brightcove Player is the same as localizing the In-Page Embed version. All you need to do is include the wanted languages and set the preferred language in the browser. Both of these procedures are detailed earlier in this document. There is no code to modify.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="alteraddlanguage" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Alter/Add to language</h2>
    <p>If you wish to change, or add to, the given localizations found at the <a href="//github.com/videojs/video.js/tree/master/lang">Video.js language page</a> it is quite easy to do. You can copy the given translations and then modify as you wish. For instance, below are the German translations with <strong>Hello</strong> and <strong>Goodbye</strong> added to the list. (For brevity's sake, not all the control elements translations are included.)</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript">videojs.addLanguage("de", {
  "Play": "Wiedergabe",
  "Pause": "Pause",
  "Current Time": "Aktueller Zeitpunkt",
  "Hello": "Guten Tag",
  "Goodbye": "Auf Wiedersehen"
});  </code></pre>
    <p>This JavaScript could be in the HTML page itself, included as a source in a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag, but the best approach is to simply add the script to the player's configuration using Studio. The URL to the file is added in the <strong>Plugins</strong> section of the player's properties. Use the <strong>Add a File</strong> button to add the JavaScript file, as shown here:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="add script in Studio" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/localization/localization-studio-add-script.png" /></figure>
    <p>Once the added vocabulary is in the language file, you can use the player's <code>localize()</code> method to access it. The following code snippet shows the localized word for <strong>Hello</strong> being used in the HTML page, followed by a screenshot of the results.</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html">  &lt;p id="textTarget"&gt;In here: &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
    videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
      var myPlayer = this;
      <span class="bcls-highlight">document.getElementById("textTarget").innerHTML += myPlayer.localize("Hello");</span>
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="page text localization" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/localization/localization-page-text.png" /></figure>
