      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong translate="No">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong translate="No">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong translate="No">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>
          </ol>

      <summary><h2 id="Development_sequence">Development sequence</h2></summary> 
      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove Player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

    <p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player you create for this sample.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>No other HTML elements are added to the page.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">To understand the code for this sample you need to know that chapters are actually stored as cue points with the <code translate="No">kind</code> defined as <code translate="No">chapters</code>.</aside>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Extract the cue points array from the video information.</li>
      <li>Build an array that contains the start times of all chapters associated with a video.</li>
      <li>Call a function that makes the marks on the progress bar. You will pass the array of chapter start times along with the video duration.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Retrieve data structure that contains chapter cue points</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Use the array filter function to retrieve data structure that contains chapter cue points ###</code></pre>
    <p>You need to extract the data from the video information that holds the cue points (acting as chapters). You need to use the JavaScript array function <code translate="No">filter</code>. Since we do not have an array with which we are interacting, simply use an empty array. Hence the code <code translate="No">[].filter</code>. For more information see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter">Array.prototype.filter()</a>.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 2 -->
    
    <h3>Extract chapter startTimes and store in array</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Loop over chapter cue points and get start time of each ###</code></pre>
    <p>This is fairly straight forward code to loop over the array of cue points and place each cue point's <code translate="No">startTime</code> into an array.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Place marks on the progress bar</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Call function to create marks in progressbar ###</code></pre>
    <p>You call the method to place the marks on the progress bar. You pass the chapter's start times array and the video duration. In the function you first get a reference to the progress bar element using JavaScript's <code translate="No">document.getElementsByClassName()</code> method. Next you loop over the array of cue points, and for each cue point dynamically create a div, calculate a percentage of where it should be place on the progress bar, then use JavaScript's <code translate="No">appendChild()</code> method to place the mark on the progress bar.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE CSS description -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>CSS is used to control the look of the chapter markers:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-css" translate="No">.vjs-marker {
  position: absolute;
  opacity: 1;
  height: 100%;
  background-color: blue;
  width: 4px;
}</code></pre>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>Normally when converting the JavaScript into a Brightcove Player plugin nominal changes are needed. One required change is to replace the standard use of the <code translate="No">ready()</code> method with the code that defines a plugin.</p>
    <p>Here is the very commonly used start to JavaScript code that will work with the player:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
    <p>You will change the first line to use the standard syntax to start a Brightcove Player plugin:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.registerPlugin('pluginName', function(options) {
  var myPlayer = this;
  ...
});</code></pre>
    <!-- UPDATE path to plugin's JavaScript -->
    
    <p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18674-chapter-markers-progress-bar/blob/master/plugin/chapter-markers.js">chapter-markers.js</a>.</p>
    <h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>
    <p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>
