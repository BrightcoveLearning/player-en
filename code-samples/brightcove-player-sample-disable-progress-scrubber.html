  <h1>Brightcove Player Sample: Disable the Progress Scrubber</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn how to use a Brightcove Player while hiding or disabling the progress scrubber. This may be useful for training videos, where you want users to watch the entire video without the ability to fast-forward through the video using the progress scrubber.</summary>

      <summary><h2 id="Using_the_CodePen">Using the CodePen</h2></summary>
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong translate="No">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong translate="No">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong translate="No">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>

      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove Player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player you create for this sample.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>No other HTML elements are added to the page.</p>

    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>

    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>This sample only has a CSS file which can be placed in an Internet accessible location, and then added to your player as a plugin. For details, see the next section.</p>
    <!-- <p>Normally when converting the JavaScript into a Brightcove Player plugin nominal changes are needed. One required change is to replace the standard use of the <code translate="No">ready()</code> method with the code that defines a plugin.</p>

          <p>Here is the very commonly used start to JavaScript code that will work with the player:</p>

          <pre class="line-numbers">
                  <code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
                    var myPlayer = this;
                    ...
                  });</code></pre>

          <p>You will change the first line to use the standard syntax to start a Brightcove Player plugin:</p>

          <pre class="line-numbers">
                  <code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.registerPlugin('pluginName', function(options) {
                    var myPlayer = this;
                    ...
                  });</code></pre>

          <p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18176-Creating-a-Video-Loop/blob/master/plugin/video-loop.js">video-loop.js</a>.</p> -->
    
    <h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>
    <p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>

    <h2 id="Alternate_solution">Alternate solution</h2>
    <p>Instead of disabling the progress scrubber, you may want to hide it all together. You can easily do this with the following CSS:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html" translate="No">/* hide the progress scrubber but keep the element spacing */
.vjs-progress-control {
    visibility: hidden;
}</code></pre>
