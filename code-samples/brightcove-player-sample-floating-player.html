  <h1>Brightcove Player Sample: Floating Player</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn how to configure the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the page to allow the player to be dragged to a new position and then fix it there (until dragged again). The player position will then remain fixed even when the user scrolls up and down the page.</summary>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">This sample and associated code is provided as a guide for your production development. The code is not certified for production use nor officially supported.</aside>
    <p>Using the plus sign (<strong>+</strong>) to the top-left of the player, drag the player to a location and drop it. Then scroll the page text up and down and you will see the player stays fixed in location.</p>

    <h2 id="Using_the_CodePen" class="bcls-expander-head">Using the CodePen</h2>
    <div class="bcls-expander-content">
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong>Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Applicaton_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong>EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Applicaton_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2 id="developmentsequence" class="bcls-expander-head">Development sequence</h2>
    <div class="bcls-expander-content">
      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/node/18081">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="API/Plugin_resources_used">API/Plugin resources used</h2>
    <p>No Brightcove Player API resources are used in this sample. It is all CSS and JavaScript.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>
    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player you create for this sample.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>An HTML <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> tag wraps the player code.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE application flow -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create an event handler for the <code>onmousedown</code> event (begin dragging)</li>
      <li>Create an event handler for the <code>onmouseup</code> event (dropping)</li>
      <li>Create an event handler for the <code>onmousemove</code> event (dragging)</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Act on mouse down</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Act on mouse down ###</code></pre>
    <p>Prepares for dragging of the player and sets the event handler for <code>onmousemove</code>.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 2 -->
    
    <h3>Act on mouse move</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Act on mouse move ###</code></pre>
    <p>Tracks the mouse position on the screen.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Act on mouse up</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript">// ### Act on mouse up ###</code></pre>
    <p>Sets the player position and clears multiple event handlers, for instance <code>onmousemove</code>.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE CSS description -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>The CSS for <code>#playerWrapper:before</code> defines the circle with the plug sign in it that is located at the top-left of the player. The CSS for <code>#playerWrapper</code> defines the border around the player.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>In this sample there is no actual Brightcove Player plugin since no Brightcove Player API code is used. The JavaScript and CSS can be moved to separate files and linked to in the code. This is what is shown in the <a href="//github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18195-floating-player/tree/master/plugin"><strong>plugin</strong></a> folder in GitHub.</p>
