      <summary><h2 id="Using_the_CodePen">Using the CodePen</h2></summary>
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong translate="No">Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong translate="No">HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong translate="No">EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Application_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>

      <summary><h2 id="Development_sequence">Development sequence</h2></summary> 
      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove Player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

  <!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>
    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player you create for this sample. Of course, for this sample the player's code is NOT initially placed in the HTML page, it is dynamically built and injected.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>A <code translate="No">&lt;button&gt;</code> is added to the HTML page that triggers the building and injection of the player. Also, a <code translate="No">&lt;div&gt;</code> element is added as the injection location.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE application flow -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Set variable values with the account ID, player ID and video ID you wish to use.</li>
      <li>On button click, a valid <code translate="No">&lt;video&gt;</code> tag is built using simple string concatenation and that string injected into the HTML page.</li>
      <li>A valid player's <code translate="No">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag is also built and injected into the HTML page. When this is done, the JavaScript will be executed on the page, dispatching an <code translate="No">onload</code> event. In the <code translate="No">onload</code> event handler, call the function that initializes the player.</li>
      <li>In the called function, use the <code translate="No">bc()</code> method to initialize the generic video tag into a Brightcove Player, then call the <code translate="No">play()</code> method.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>Supply desired account ID, player ID and video ID</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Set the data for the player ###</code></pre>
    <p>Assign variables the desired values for player configuration.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 2 -->
    
    <h3>Build the player's in-page embed implementation code, and inject into the page</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Build the player and place in HTML DOM ###</code></pre>
    <p>This is JavaScript work. Use string concatenation to build a valid <code translate="No">&lt;video&gt;</code> tag. You then inject the tag into the HTML page. Next you build a valid Brightcove Player <code translate="No">&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. When you append this to the HTML page, the JavaScript will automatically be executed. This creates an <code translate="No">onload</code> event, for which you can write a handler.</p>
    <!-- UPDATE task 3 -->
    
    <h3>Initialize the player as a Brightcove Player, and play the video</h3>
    <p>Find the code which is labeled:</p>
    <pre>
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">// ### Initialize the player and start the video ###</code></pre>
    <p>You use the standard <code translate="No">bc()</code> method to initialize the generic player as a Brightcove Player, then play the video using the <code translate="No">play()</code> method.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE CSS description -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>The only CSS controls the size of the player.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="iframe_implementation">iframe implementation</h2>
    <p>The iframe implementation can be used in a very similar way as shown above. <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18169-loading-player-dynamically/blob/master/iframe-sample.html">Sample code</a> is available. If you wish to have the video play on load, the best thing to do is in the Player Module in the Video Cloud Studio. Set the player's <strong>Auto-Play Video on Player Load</strong> property under the Playback setting to anything but “Do Not Auto-Play” option.</p>

    </figure>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>This sample's code will not run as a Brightcove Player plugin as the player must exist before a plugin can be registered with it. Of course, you can save the JavaScript in a separate file and import it if you choose.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Removing_a_player">Removing a player</h2>
    <p>You may wish to dynamically remove a player. To do so you should use the <code translate="No">myPlayer.dispose()</code> method. You do NOT want to remove the player from the DOM via JavaScript as this could cause memory leaks. When you use the <code translate="No">dispose()</code> method, the player will remove itself from the DOM.</p>
