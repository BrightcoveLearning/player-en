    <h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>
    <p> An Outstream player generates paid video ad impressions without requiring video content behind it. It can generate incremental ad revenue beyond the current video content and viewership support. Brightcove core player technology, along with Client-side Ad Insertion with built-in IMA, this player type can be added to in-text environments across desktop and mobile web. This player type will only display to the user when a valid ad response is available.
      Ads may be delivered from the ad server of choice. Alternately, Brightcove can handle the fulfillment of advertising and player setup and management on your behalf through our Ad Monetization Managed Service offering. Deliver video ads fulfilled by BCOV Ad Monetization Services alone or alongside your ad fulfillment.</p>
