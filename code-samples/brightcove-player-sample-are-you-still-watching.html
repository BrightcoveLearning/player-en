  <h1>Brightcove Player Sample: Are You Still Watching?</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn how to create a Brightcove Player that detects when the viewer has stopped watching, while leaving the video playing.</summary>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">This sample and associated code is provided as a guide for your production development. The code is not certified for production use nor officially supported.</aside>
    <p>In this sample you will see after a set amount of time, an overlay message is displayed. This sample will display the overlay in 6 seconds, but the time is configurable. If the viewer clicks the message within a specified time, then playback continues. If not, the video is paused. This technique is useful if you have long-form content. This will keep you from wasting bandwidth on viewers who start playing a video and then leave to do something else without bothering to stop it.</p>
    <p>This sample uses an open source Video.js Plugin located at <a href="https://github.com/TylerZubke/Videojs-AFK-Monitor">https://github.com/TylerZubke/Videojs-AFK-Monitor</a>. The sample code in this document will utilize this plugin.</p>

    <h2 id="Using_the_CodePen" class="bcls-expander-head">Using the CodePen</h2>
    <div class="bcls-expander-content">
      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong>Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Later in this document the logic, flow and styling used in the application will be discussed in the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Applicaton_flow">Application flow</a> and <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections. The best way to follow along with the information in those sections is to:
          <ol>
            <li>Click the <strong>EDIT ON CODEPEN</strong> button in the CodePen and have the code available in one browser/browser tab.</li>
            <li>In CodePen, adjust what code you want displayed. You can change the width of different code sections within CodePen.</li>
            <li>View the <a href="#Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</a>, <a href="#Applicaton_flow">Application flow</a> and/or <a href="#Application_styling">Application styling</a> sections in another browser/browser tab. You will now be able to follow the code explanations and at the same time view the code.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="developmentsequence" class="bcls-expander-head">Development sequence</h2>
    <div class="bcls-expander-content">
      <p>Here is the recommended development sequence:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the In-Page embed player implementation to test the functionality of your player, plugin and CSS (if CSS is needed)</li>
        <li>Put the plugin's JavaScript and CSS into separate files for local testing</li>
        <li>Deploy the plugin code and CSS to your server once you have worked out any errors</li>
        <li>Use Studio to add the plugin and CSS to your player</li>
        <li>Replace the In-Page embed player implementation if you determine that the iframe implementation is a better fit (detailed in next section)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For details about these steps, review the <a href="/coding-topics/step-step-plugin-development.html">Step-by-Step: Plugin Development</a> guide.</p>
      <h3>iframe or In-Page embed</h3>
      <p>When developing enhancements for the Brightcove Player you will need to decide if the code is a best fit for the iframe or In-Page embed implementation. The best practice recommendation is to build a plugin for use with an iframe implementation. The advantages of using the iframe player are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>No collisions with existing JavaScript and/or CSS</li>
        <li>Automatically responsive</li>
        <li>The iframe eases use in social media apps (or whenever the video will need to "travel" into other apps)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although integrating the In-Page embed player can be more complex, there are times when you will plan your code around that implementation. To generalize, this approach is best when the containing page needs to communicate to the player. Specifically, here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code in the containing page needs to listen for and act on player events</li>
        <li>The player uses styles from the containing page</li>
        <li>The iframe will cause app logic to fail, like a redirect from the containing page</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even if your final implementation does not use the iframe code, you can still use the In-Page embed code with a plugin for your JavaScript and a separate file for your CSS. This encapsulates your logic so that you can easily use it in multiple players.</p>

  <!-- UPDATE player and HTML configuration -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Player/HTML_configuration">Player/HTML configuration</h2>
    <p>This section details any special configuration needed during player creation. In addition, other HTML elements that must be added to the page, beyond the in-page embed player implementation code, are described.</p>
    <h3>Player configuration</h3>
    <p>No special configuration is required for the Brightcove Player you create for this sample.</p>
    <h3>Other HTML</h3>
    <p>The third party plugin's CSS and JavaScript files are included.</p>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE application flow -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_flow">Application flow</h2>
    <p>The basic logic behind this application is:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The <code>useractive</code> and <code>userinactive</code> events are watched to track time.</li>
      <li>The overlay is displayed after the time specified to see if customer is still watching the video.</li>
      <li>When the overlay has been displayed for the time you specify, and the text has not been clicked, pause the video.</li>
      <li>When the button is clicked, or the viewer starts the video after pause, reinitialize values and start time tracking again.</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- UPDATE task 1 -->
    
    <h3>This sample uses the plugin</h3>
    <p>The plugin is called using best practices, as shown here</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-html">&lt;script&gt;
    videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() {
      var myPlayer = this;
      var options = {'showMessageAfter': 1000, 'pausePlayerAfter': 1000};
      myPlayer.AFKMonitor(options);
    });
  &lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <h3>Configuring the plugin</h3>
    <p>A number of options can be used to customize the plugin. Some details are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A complete list of configuration options are found in the plugin's <a href="https://github.com/TylerZubke/Videojs-AFK-Monitor">readme</a> file.</li>
      <li>The <code>showMessageAfter</code> (in milliseconds) determines the time before the button is displayed.
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning language-editable">Note that since the plugin uses the <code>userinactive</code> event, the time set by <code>showMessageAfter</code> will have 5 seconds added to it. This is because the <code>userinactive</code> event is dispatched after 5 seconds of user inactivity.</aside>
      </li>
      <li>The <code>pausePlayerAfter</code> (in milliseconds) options is also helpful. This is time you allow the user to click the button before the player is paused. This give the user a chance to click the button without interrupting video playback.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip language-editable">If you wish to use this plugin with Brightcove Live, you should use the modified plugin located at <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18189-are-you-still-watching/blob/master/plugin/videojs.afk-monitor-live.js">https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18189-are-you-still-watching/blob/master/plugin/videojs.afk-monitor-live.js</a>.</aside>
  </section>
  <!-- UPDATE CSS description -->
  
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Application_styling">Application styling</h2>
    <p>The CSS is part of the third party plugin.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Plugin_code">Plugin code</h2>
    <p>You will want to clone the repo to access the code and then place it in an Internet accessible location for your use.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">You will want to update the plugin's JavaScript code. In the repo the following, now outdated, code is used to register the plugin:
      <pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-javascript">videojs.plugin('AFKMonitor', AFKMonitor);</code></pre>
      <p>You should replace that line of code with:</p>
      <pre class="line-numbers">
  <code class="language-javascript">videojs.registerPlugin('AFKMonitor', AFKMonitor);</code></pre>
    </aside>
    <p>As mentioned earlier, you can see the plugin's JavaScript code in this document's corresponding GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/18189-are-you-still-watching/blob/master/plugin/videojs.afk-monitor.js">videojs.afk-monitor.js</a>.</p>
    <h3>Using the plugin with a player</h3>
    <p>Once you have the plugin's CSS and JavaScript files stored in an Internet accessible location, you can use the plugin with a player. In Studio's <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module you can choose a player, then in the <strong>PLUGINS</strong> section add the URLs to the CSS and JavaScript files, and also add the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Options</strong>, if options are needed.</p>
