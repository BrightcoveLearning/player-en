    <p>This feature requires an additional fee. Video Cloud offers other options for protecting your content across devices. See <a href="/content-protection/overview-content-protection.html">Overview: Content Protection</a> for more information. Contact your Account Manager about bundling DRM protection so that you can secure your content wherever it plays.</p>

    <p>Publisher accounts looking to use Smooth Streaming with PlayReady in Video Cloud will need to have their Video Cloud account configured by Brightcove Support. You should contact <a href="https://supportportal.brightcove.com">Brightcove Support</a> and request that your account be configured to support PlayReady.</p>

    <p>With Dynamic Delivery, packaging in the format requested (for eg. PlayReady) is done Just-In-Time during playback. Playready can be delivered with Smooth Streaming or DASH.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note that there are concurrency limits for PlayReady defined in your service agreement with Microsoft. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/playready/features/concurrency-limiting">this Microsoft document</a> for information on managing concurrency. If the concurrency limit is exceeded for a video, it will fail to play for viewers beyond the maximum number.</aside>

    <h3>Smooth Streaming + PlayReady</h3>

    <p>Typically, publishers using Smooth w/ PlayReady integrate with custom player implementations. Client applications should make straightforward HTTP calls to Brightcove servers to obtain the correct playback URLs via <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/playback/references/reference_v1.html#api-Video-Get_Video_by_ID_or_Reference_ID">Playback API</a> (or <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/references/reference.html#api-videoGroup-Get_Video_Sources">CMS API sources endpoint</a>). With packaging for Smooth Streaming done at the Brightcove origin level, URL to the Smooth Manifest is all that is needed to begin playback.</p>

    <p>Here is a snippet from the Playback API response:</p>

    <p>By default, client side Smooth manifests required for playback are delivered with an .ismc extension. If you are a Video Cloud customer currently delivering Smooth Streaming and are expecting to receive an ISM URL with /Manifest appended to the path during Playback, please contact Customer Support to enable your setup for compatibility with your workflows.</p>

    <h3>MPEG-DASH + PlayReady</h3>

    <p>Since MPEG-DASH is encrypted with Common Encryption (CENC), it can be decrypted with Playready or Widevine DRM license formats. If delivering content to HBBTV devices is a requirement for you, please contact your account manager to enable delivery of HbbTV variant of DASH (encrypted using PlayReady) for your account. Similarly, <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/playback/references/reference_v1.html#api-Video-Get_Video_by_ID_or_Reference_ID">Playback API</a> (or <a href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/cms/references/reference.html#api-videoGroup-Get_Video_Sources">CMS API sources endpoint</a>) can be used to retrieve your DASH manifests (both desktop and HbbTV).</p>

    <h2 id="Limitations">Limitations</h2>

    <p>The following limitations apply to streaming PlayReady protected content using Dynamic Delivery:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Our content is currently encrypted using PlayReady DRM using 8 byte Initialization Vectors (IV) except in the case of HbbTV 1.5, where we use 16 byte IVs. For details about Playready DRM, see Microsoft's <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/playready/specifications/mpeg-dash-playready">DASH Content Protection using Microsoft PlayReady</a> document.</li>
