    <p>Playback technology refers to the specific browser or plugin technology used to play the video or audio. (The playback technology will usually be referred to simply as a <strong>Tech</strong>.)</p>

    <h2>Brightcove Player techs</h2>
    <p>The Brightcove Player will do everything it can to play your content using HTML5. Only when it cannot, it will fall back to using Flash. To do this, the Brightcove Player's default Tech order is <code translate="No">["html5","flash"]</code>. Let's examine these Techs:</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Additional techs are supported by Video.js, but they are not part of the official Brightcove Player product. For details, see the <a href="https://docs.videojs.com/tutorial-tech_.html">Video.js Playback Technology</a> guide.</aside>
    <h3>HTML5 tech</h3>
    <p>The Brightcove Player uses the HTML5 playback technology supplied by the browser for handling the <code translate="No">&lt;video&gt;</code> or <code translate="No">&lt;audio&gt;</code> element. This means that the Brightcove Player will look for an appropriate rendition to be played using the browser's HTML5 playback technology, but it will vary between browsers.</p>
    <p>If you are curious to find out what your specific browser and player are using, try the <a href="#determineTech">playback app</a> in the next section.</p>
    <h3>Flash tech</h3>
    <p>If a browser does not support HTML5 media, then the Brightcove Player will fall back to using Flash. Brightcove has designed this tech to function similar to the video element.</p>

    <h2 id="techOrdering">Technology ordering</h2>
    <p>By default, the Brightcove Player uses source-first selection when searching for a source/tech combination to play. This means that the player will try to play a video with every tech before moving on to the next video source.</p>
    <p>Even though the Brightcove Player only uses the Flash tech in browsers that do not support HTML5 media, you may choose to turn off the Flash tech. In this case, the player would never use Flash to deliver your video content, and your video would be delivered with progressive download of an MP4 rendition. To do this, use the following:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">{"techOrder": ["html5"]}</code></pre>
    <p>For details about technology ordering, see the <a href="https://github.com/videojs/video.js/blob/master/docs/guides/tech.md">Video.js Playback Technology</a> notes.</p>

    <h2 id="determineTech">Determining playback tech</h2>
    <p>The best way to determine which rendition source type and playback technology is being used with the current browser is to run an app in the browser. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Open the <a href="/troubleshooting/brightcove-playback-technology-app.html">Playback Technology App</a> in your browser.</li>
      <li>Replace the default input values with your own account, player and video.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Your output should look similar to this:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="playback tech app" src="/assets/images/playback/playback-tech-app.png" /></figure>

    <h2 id="viewTechManually" class="bcls-expander-head">Viewing playback tech manually</h2>
    <div class="bcls-expander-content">
      <p>It may be helpful to manually determine which playback tech is being used by your player within the browser. Let's take a look at a video playing in the Chrome browser.</p>
      <h3>Source type</h3>
      <p>First, let's see which rendition source type is currently being used. With your video in the Chrome browser, open Developer Tools to view the console messages. In the console's command prompt, enter the following:</p>
      <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayers().video_1.currentSrc()</code></pre>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The <code translate="No">video_1</code> section of the entry represents the ID of the player in this case. If you are experimenting and have a player with an ID, that ID will replace <code translate="No">video_1</code>.</aside>
      <p>You should see that the current source file has an extension value of <strong>m3u8</strong>.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="tech name" src="/assets/images/playback/hls-rendition.png" /></figure>
      <p>You might not expect the hls rendition to be playing in this browser, since Chrome does not natively support hls. But, the Brightcove Player plays hls using MSE (Media Source Extensions) in the Chrome browser.</p>
      <h3>vjs-tech class</h3>
      <p>Next, let's verify that HTML5 is being used to play the hls rendition. In the console's command prompt, enter the following to return the first player element which uses the class named <code translate="No">vjs-tech</code>:</p>
      <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-javascript" translate="No">document.getElementsByClassName("vjs-tech")[0]</code></pre>
      <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="tech name" src="/assets/images/playback/tech-details.png" /></figure>
      <p>Here, you can see that the HTML5 <code translate="No">video</code> element is being used.</p>
