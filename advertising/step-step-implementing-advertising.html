    <p>To be sure the VAST ad tag you have is valid with Google follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Obtain an ad tag. (If you do not have one, use the one that follows this step for demo purposes.) In this quick start it is assumed you have an ad that includes a pre-roll, but any inline ad will work.

<code class="language-html" translate="No">https://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/brightcove-player/vmap/simple-vmap.xml</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>To verify the validity of your ad tag, be sure you have copied its URL and browse to the following page:
        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://googleads.github.io/googleads-ima-html5/vsi/">Video Suite Inspector</a> (clicking this link will cause the page to open in a new window or tab). If you are using the supplied URL from step 1, you will see the ad tag plays a pre-roll, a mid-roll at 5 seconds and a post-roll.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Paste your ad tag URL into the <strong>Input type</strong> form input field.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>TEST AD</strong> and you will see your ad play, followed by the Google supplied video content.</li>
      <!--   				<li>To verify your ad tag is compatible with Brightcove Player and its IMA Plugin, browse to the following page:
                  <p><a href="//players.brightcove.net/2549849259001/bc-ima3-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brightcove Player with Advertisements</a> (clicking this link will cause the page to open in a new window or tab)</p></li>
                  <li>Paste your ad tag URL into the <strong>Ad Server URL</strong> form input field.</li>
                  <li>Click <strong>Update</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Play the video. You will see your ad play, followed by the Brightcove supplied bird video.</li> -->
      <!-- <li>Be sure both of these tests complete successfully, then proceed to the next section. If either of these tests failed, you need to check your ad tag.</li> -->
      <li>Be sure the test complete successfully, then proceed to the next section. If the test failed, you need to check your ad tag.</li>

    <p>Brightcove Player relies on the IMA3 Plugin to play VAST ads. To add said plugin to a player, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Login to Studio.</li>

      <li>Click the link for the player to open the player's properties.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Advertising</strong> in the left navigation menu.</li>
      <li>Check the <strong>Enable Client-Side (IMA)</strong>.</li>
      <li>For the <strong>Ad Tag</strong>, enter the ad tag from above. For testing, you can use the following:
        <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html" translate="No">https://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/brightcove-player/vmap/simple-vmap.xml</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Leave the other values as the defaults. Your <strong>Advertising</strong> section should appear as follows:
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio advertising" src="/assets/images/advertising/sbs-studio-advertising-ui.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>

      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>In Studio navigate to the Media module by selecting <strong>MEDIA</strong> from the drop down main menu.</li>

          <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio select video" src="/assets/images/advertising/sbs-qs-select-video.png" /></figure>
        </li>
        <li>From the select control, in the <strong>Select Player</strong> section of the page, choose your newly created player.
          <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio publish" src="/assets/images/advertising/sbs-qs-publish-ui-select.png" /></figure>
        </li>
        <li>You now have access to the three implementations of the player, <strong>Preview in browser</strong>, <strong>Standard</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>. Do not close this window as you will be clicking a link from it.
          <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio see implementations" src="/assets/images/advertising/sbs-qs-publish-ui.png" /></figure>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">Note: If curious, you can see "under the hood" of the player configuration using the URL code. Click on the <strong>Preview in browser</strong> code link, then copy and browse the generated URL. Next, change the <strong>index.html</strong> at the end of the URL to <strong>config.json</strong>.
