    <h2 id="verify">Verify VAST tag</h2>
    <p>To be sure the VAST ad tag you have is valid with Google follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Obtain an ad tag. (If you do not have one, use the one that follows this step for demo purposes.) In this quick start it is assumed you have an ad that includes a pre-roll, but any inline ad will work.
        <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html" translate="No">https://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/brightcove-player/vmap/simple-vmap.xml</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>To verify the validity of your ad tag, be sure you have copied its URL and browse to the following page:
        <p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="//developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/vastinspector_dual">Video Suite Inspector</a> (clicking this link will cause the page to open in a new window or tab). If you are using the supplied URL from step 1, you will see the ad tag plays a pre-roll, a mid-roll at 5 seconds and a post-roll.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Paste your ad tag URL into the <strong>Input type</strong> form input field.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>TEST AD</strong> and you will see your ad play, followed by the Google supplied motorcycle race video.</li>
      <!--   				<li>To verify your ad tag is compatible with Brightcove Player and its IMA Plugin, browse to the following page:
                  <p><a href="//players.brightcove.net/2549849259001/bc-ima3-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brightcove Player with Advertisements</a> (clicking this link will cause the page to open in a new window or tab)</p></li>
                  <li>Paste your ad tag URL into the <strong>Ad Server URL</strong> form input field.</li>
                  <li>Click <strong>Update</strong>.</li>
                  <li>Play the video. You will see your ad play, followed by the Brightcove supplied bird video.</li> --><!-- <li>Be sure both of these tests complete successfully, then proceed to the next section. If either of these tests failed, you need to check your ad tag.</li> -->
      <li>Be sure the test complete successfully, then proceed to the next section. If the test failed, you need to check your ad tag.</li>
    </ol>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The VAST ad tag can be hosted by your ad provider, or you can copy the XML and host it on your own URL.</aside>

    <h2 id="enable-advertising">Enable advertising</h2>
    <p>Brightcove Player relies on the IMA3 Plugin to play VAST ads. To add said plugin to a player, follow these steps.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Login to Studio.</li>
      <li>Open the <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module and either create a new player or locate the player to which you wish to add advertising functionality.</li>
      <li>Click the link for the player to open the player's properties.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Advertising</strong> in the left navigation menu.</li>
      <li>Check the <strong>Enable Client-Side (IMA)</strong>.</li>
      <li>For the <strong>Ad Tag</strong>, enter the ad tag from above. For testing, you can use the following:
        <pre class="line-numbers">
<code class="language-html" translate="No">https://solutions.brightcove.com/bcls/brightcove-player/vmap/simple-vmap.xml</code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>Leave the other values as the defaults. Your <strong>Advertising</strong> section should appear as follows:
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio advertising" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/advertising/ads-quick-start/studio-advertising-ui.png" /></figure>
      </li>

      <h2 id="publishvideo">Publish video in player</h2>
      <p>You publish a video in the newly created player in the Media module. Once you associate the video with your player you publish the video and will then have access to three implementations in which to view the video in your player.</p>
      <p>To publish a video your player, follow these steps:</p>
      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>In Studio navigate to the Media module by selecting <strong>MEDIA</strong> from the drop down main menu.</li>
        <li>Select the video you wish to publish to your player. In the top row of buttons, select <strong>Publish and Embed</strong> and then <strong>Web Player</strong>.
          <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio select video" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/advertising/ads-quick-start/qs-select-video.png" /></figure>
        </li>
        <li>From the select control, in the <strong>Select Player</strong> section of the page, choose your newly created player.
          <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio publish" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/advertising/ads-quick-start/qs-publish-ui-select.png" /></figure>
        </li>
        <li>You now have access to the three implementations of the player, <strong>Preview in browser</strong>, <strong>Standard</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong>. Do not close this window as you will be clicking a link from it.
          <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio see implementations" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/advertising/ads-quick-start/qs-publish-ui.png" /></figure>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">Note: If curious, you can see "under the hood" of the player configuration using the URL code. Click on the <strong>Preview in browser</strong> code link, then copy and browse the generated URL. Next, change the <strong>index.html</strong> at the end of the URL to <strong>config.json</strong>. You will see a JSON object detailing the current configuration of the player you just created.</aside>

      <h2 id="assignvideo1">Assign video to player</h2>
      <p>The Video Content properties are used to assign video content to the player.</p>

        <li>Add the rendition or renditions of your choice.</li>
        <li>Add a poster image. If you do not add a poster image the first frame of the video will be used.</li>
        <li>Do not set any dimensions for the video as this will be done via CSS in the page.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
        <li>Follow the process to publish your player.</li>
      </ol>

      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="player-only">
      <p>Of course, you will want to be sure the ad is working in your player. In this case you will test using the preview version of the player so there is no need to wait for the player to actually be published. Although the publish time is not long, using the preview version of the player eliminates any confusion of something not working because the player has not completed publishing.</p>

      <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
        <li>Near the top of the page select <strong>Embed Code &amp; URL</strong> then <strong>Preview Player</strong>.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>Player URL</strong>.</li>
