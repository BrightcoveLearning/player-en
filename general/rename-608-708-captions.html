    <p>608 captions, also known as CEA-608 captions, EIA-608 captions and Line 21 captions, are a standard for closed captioning for NTSC TV analog broadcasts in the United States and Canada. The 608 captions can be inserted into a live stream where they are mixed into the HLS <span translate="no">ts</span> (transport stream) files.</p>
    <p>The 608 specification doesn't allow for custom naming of captions tracks, and by default will always be named <code translate="No">CC1</code> or <code translate="No">CC2</code>, regardless of the language being used.</p>
