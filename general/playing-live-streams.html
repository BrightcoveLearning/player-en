    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Brightcove Player provides functionality to play live streams out of the box. No configuration changes need to be made.</p>
    <p>In Brightcove Player versions previous to 6.33.0 the <strong>Live DVRUX plugin</strong> was required. <strong>The Live DVRUX plugin is now deprecated and&nbsp; should no longer&nbsp;be used.</strong></p>

    <h2 id="What_you_see_in_the_Live_UI">What you see in the Live UI</h2>
    <p>If you are playing a live stream, the player automatically senses this and provides a user interface (UI) tailored to the stream. When the video is playing the live feed real time, you see <strong>Live</strong> indicator will have a red circle next to it, as shown here:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="liveui ui" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/liveui/liveui-ui.png" /></figure>
    <p>If the stream allows, and you use the DVR functionality and the scrubber to click back in the feed, you see the <strong>Live</strong> indicator has a gray circle beside it, and the scrubber indicates where you are in the stream, as shown in the following screenshot (this backward scrubbing is dependent on the particular live stream and the number of past video segments that it makes available):</p>

    <p>If you are using DVR functionality and want to return to real time live feed, you can click the <strong>Live</strong> indicator, as shown here:</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="liveui ui click to go live again" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/liveui/liveui-ui-click-live.png" /></figure>
