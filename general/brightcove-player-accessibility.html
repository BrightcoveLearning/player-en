    <h2 id="screen_readers">Screen readers</h2>
    <p>The Brightcove Player is compatible with screen readers on desktop browsers as well as iOS and Android devices.</p>
    <p>The most recent tests are against the WCAG 2.0 AA standards using the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>TalkBack on latest Android</li>
      <li>VoiceOver on iOS 9+</li>
      <li>Windows Narrator with IE10+</li>
      <li>The latest version of JAWS on Windows with Firefox and Chrome on Windows</li>
      <li>Mac OS VoiceOver with Safari, Chrome and Firefox</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">When the JAWS screen reader is used with the Google Chrome browser, keyboard controls may not work as expected. Holding the Shift key while using keyboard controls may alleviate the problem. However, it is recommended to use Firefox with JAWS instead.</aside>
