      <p>Brightcove is committed to accessibility with Brightcove Player and has worked with a third-party accessibility vendor to ensure that Brightcove Player meets the standards set out in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1 AA</a> accessibility guidelines.</p>
      <p>The most recent Brightcove Player tests against the WCAG 2.1 AA standards included the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manual assessment using Chrome on Windows 10 and exclusive use of the keyboard</li>
        <li>Automated tools used including the Deque aXe browser extension & Deque aXe Auditor</li>
        <li>Assistive technologies employed including the latest version of NVDA</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Upon request, Brightcove can provide you with a VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template). Please contact your account manager or sales contact for a copy of Brightcove's VPAT.</p>
      <p>At Brightcove, accessibility is important, and we welcome customer feedback.</p>

      <h3>Notes on Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Accessibility is a complex subject and we understand that our customers may have questions about it. The information provided here is for informational purposes only and is not legal advice. You should contact your attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular question or issue.</p>

      <h3>What is WCAG?</h3>
      <p>WCAG is a list of accessibility success criteria to which you can meet.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>WCAG guidelines are written by the W3C</li>
        <li>Meeting WCAG success criteria can be achieved in multiple ways</li>
        <li>Following W3C's guidelines is one way of meeting those criteria</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The W3C itself recommends that the only required objective is to meet the criteria, but not how it can be done.</p>

      <h2 id="Brightcove_Player_Accessibility_FAQ">Brightcove Player Accessibility FAQ</h2>
      <p>Here are some common questions and answers about accessibility when using Brightcove Plaeyr.</p>

      <details>
        <summary>What version of the player is compliant with WCAG 2.1 AA?</summary>
        <p>Brightcove's most recent set of tests were validated against player version <strong>6.64.3</strong>, with the default skin with the blue progress bar indicator (also known as the <strong>Sapphire</strong> skin). Brightcove worked with a third-party vendor to ensure an unbiased review.</p>
      </details>
      <br/>

      <details>
        <summary>Is the player skin customizable?</summary>
        <p>If you run tests and find that the player skin fails on color contrast, is there anything you can do?</p>
        <p>Yes! The color scheme is customizable. For details, see the following:

        </ul>
      </details>
      <br/>

      <details>
        <summary>How can customers add a <code translate="No">title</code> to the iframe?</summary>
        <p>The WCAG guidelines require a <code translate="No">title</code> attribute when embedding the player via an iframe.</p>
        <p>Because the player dynamically loads content from the catalog, it is not possible to give the iframe a meaningful or relevant title before a video is loaded. The player is not able to update the title of the parent iframe element. Customers can add your own title to the iframe using:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript" translate="No">&lt;iframe title=&quot;My video title&quot; src=&quot;//players.brightcove.net/...&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
      </details>
      <br/>

      <details>
        <summary>Are captions present in the embed code?</summary>
        <p>During an audit you may notice that captions are not present in the embed code (WCAG 2.1 AA Success Criterion 1.2.2).</p>
        <p>Brightcove makes caption tracks available for the user. If tracks have been added to the video they will be made available to the user once the video has loaded. Similar to the <code translate="No">title</code> attribute above, the player cannot know if accompanying captions/text tracks exist until the video details have been returned by the Brightcove backend systems. In this case, the user will have the tracks, but the captions will not be present in the embed code.</p>
      </details>
      <br/>

      <details>
        <summary>Who can we reach out to with further questions?</summary>
        <p>If you've run the player through an automated tool, and an item was flagged and it's not included in VPAT or in this FAQ, you can contact Brightcove.</p>
        <p>For existing customers, please contact your Brightcove account manager.</p>
        <p>For new customers, reach out to the <a href="https://www.brightcove.com/en/contact-sales/">Brightcove sales team</a>.</p>
