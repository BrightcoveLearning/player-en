      <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>Brightcove is committed to accessibility with the Brightcove Player and has worked with a third-party accessibility vendor to ensure that the Brightcove Player meets the standards set out in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">WCAG 2.1 AA</a> accessibility guidelines.</p>
      <p>The most recent Brightcove Player tests against the WCAG 2.1 AA standards included the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Manual assessment using Chrome on Windows 10 and exclusive use of the keyboard</li>
        <li>Automated tools used including the Deque aXe browser extension & Deque aXe Auditor</li>
        <li>Assistive technologies employed including the latest version of NVDA</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Upon request, Brightcove can provide you with a VPAT (Voluntary Product Accessibility Template). Please contact your account manager or sales contact for a copy of Brightcove's VPAT.</p>
      <p>At Brightcove, accessibility is important, and we welcome customer feedback.</p>

      <h3>Notes on Accessibility</h3>
      <p>Accessibility is a complex subject and we understand that our customers may have questions about it. The information provided here is for informational purposes only and is not legal advice. You should contact your attorney to obtain advice with respect to any particular question or issue.</p>

      <h3>What is WCAG?</h3>
      <p>WCAG is a list of accessibility success criteria to which you can meet.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>WCAG guidelines are written by the W3C</li>
        <li>Meeting WCAG success criteria can be achieved in multiple ways</li>
        <li>Following W3C's guidelines is one way of meeting those criteria</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The W3C itself recommends that the only required objective is to meet the criteria, but not how it can be done.</p>
