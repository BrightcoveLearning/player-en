      <li>Click <strong>Build the Player</strong>.</li>
      <li>If this works, click <strong>Copy Code to Clipboard</strong>.</li>
      <li>Restructure your code to perform tasks in the following order: (you can paste the code from the Jump Start which is in this order)
        <ol>
          <li>Load prebid</li>
          <li>Load Brightcove Player</li>
          <li>Load IMA3 plugins</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
