    <h2 id="IMA_ads">IMA ads</h2>
    <p>If IMA ads are not playing, make sure that your ad URL is working correctly. You can do this with Google's Video Suite inspector.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>In a browser, navigate to <a href="https://googleads.github.io/googleads-ima-html5/vsi/">IMA HTML5 Video Suite Inspector</a>.</li>
      <li>Enter your VAST ad tag without header bidding into the text field.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Test Ad</strong>.</li>
      <li>You should see your ad playing in the <strong>Video Player</strong> area.</li>
      <li>If this does NOT work, here are some possible reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>An issue with your ad server</li>
          <li>Ad targeting parameters are too specific to return an ad</li>
          <li>You don't have any default/fallback ads when ad targeting fails to find an ad</li>
        </ul>

      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2 id="Header_bidding">Header bidding</h2>
    <p>If you are having issues with ads loading while using header bidding, make sure you are performing tasks in the correct order to avoid race conditions. A good way to isolate an issue from a complexity of code is to start with a simple sample.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open the <a href="/advertising/jump-start-header-bidding-ad.html">Jump Start: Header Bidding Ad</a> document.</li>
      <li>Enter values for your Video Cloud Account ID and Video ID.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Build the Player</strong>.</li>
      <li>If this works, click <strong>Copy Code to Clipboard</strong>.</li>
      <li>Restructure your code to perform tasks in the following order: (you can paste the code from the Jump Start which is in this order)
        <ol>
          <li>Load prebid</li>
          <li>Load Brightcove Player</li>
          <li>Load IMA3 plugins</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Test the new structure of code.</li>
      <li>If this works, modify the code in your .js file in the same way.</li>
    </ol>
