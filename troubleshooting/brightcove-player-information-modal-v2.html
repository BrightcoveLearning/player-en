    <h2 id="Alter_the_context_menu">Alter the context menu</h2>
    <p>You can alter the menu that appears on right-click, called the context menu. To do this you must alter the configuration of your player. You can do this in two ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Using Studio's <strong>JSON Editor</strong> from the <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module.</li>
      <li>A tool to perform the configuration change is <a href="https://general.support.brightcove.com/developer/concepts-set-curl.html">curl</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The two changes you can make, and how to affect them, are shown here.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Note: The curl statements below use the Player Management API to alter player configuration. In the curl statements you will see values of <strong>$EMAIL</strong>, <strong>$ACCOUNT_ID</strong> and <strong>$PLAYER_ID</strong>. You must either create environment variables by those names and assign corresponding values, or supply the literal values for the variables.</aside>
    <h3>Prevent the menu appearing</h3>
    <p>If you wish to prevent the player information context menu from appearing at all, you can do one of the following:</p>
    <h4>Use the JSON Editor</h4>
    <p>Alter the player's configuration by adding the highlighted property (be sure to save the change):</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="JSON Editor no debugger" src="/assets/images/troubleshooting/modal-json-editor-no-context-menu.png" /></figure>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: Whenever you make a change to a player using curl, you need to re-publish the player. You can do that in Studio, and you will see your player is marked as needing to be published in the <strong>Status</strong> column:
