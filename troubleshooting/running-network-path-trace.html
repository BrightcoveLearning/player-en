    <p>The <code translate="No">traceroute</code> diagnostic tool tracks the path from your computer to the website in question. The tool sends a sequence of packets across the network and receives responses from each router in the path. By doing this, it determines if there are any problems along the path.</p>
    <p>When working with support, you may be asked to provide them the information from tracing the network path to the website in question.</p>

    <p>Follow these steps to run a network path trace:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Open a window for the Terminal app.</li>
      <li>Enter the following command with the website in question.
        <pre>
<code class="language-html" translate="No">traceroute <span class="bcls-highlight">your_domain.com</span></code></pre>
        <p>If you know that your network uses Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), then enter the following command:</p>
        <pre>
<code class="language-html" translate="No">traceroute6 <span class="bcls-highlight">your_domain.com</span></code></pre>
      </li>
      <li>You should see the traffic path taken to your site. It will build as responses are received from the routers along the way. The first line represents your router. The next line is from your ISP, and it continues until the packets reach your website. Your output should look similar to this:
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="traceroute output" src="/assets/images/troubleshooting/trace.png" /></figure>
      </li>
      <li>Don't worry about understanding the output. From your Terminal window, select <strong>Edit</strong> &gt; <strong>Select All</strong>. Then, copy the output to your clipboard.</li>
      <li>Paste the output to an email and send it to the appropriate support personnel.</li>
    </ol>
