    <h2 id="Video_overview">Video overview</h2>
    <p>The following video shows the process of creating the network log from the Chrome browser. You will save the network log as an HTTP Archive (HAR) file, which is a JSON-formatted archive file format used for logging web browser interaction with a site.</p>
    <p>Note that the steps here guide you through creating a network log to help diagnose playback issues, but there are other cases (problems uploading videos or media assets, for example) where network logs are useful.</p>
    <p>Once you have the developer tools open, reproduce the issue you are having in full, from the very beginning. (You may need to refresh the page to achieve this.)</p>

    <p>For example, if you are having a problem with playback, open the developer tools, then refresh the page that contains the player, and then wait until the playback issue occurs.</p>

    <p>If you are having a problem with uploading, open the developer tools, then start uploading, and then wait until the upload reaches failure or completion.</p>

    <p>The developer tools need to be open before, during, and after the issue is reproduced.</p>

    <p>Following the video, the process for creating a network log related to playback issues is shown in a step-by-step format.</p>
