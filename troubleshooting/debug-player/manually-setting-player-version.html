    <p>You may have to rollback to a previous player version as you find a player upgrade is causing an issue. You can rollback to a previous version until testing is completed to find the reason for the issue and it is resolved.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">For a thorough discussion of player version settings in Studio, see the <a href="https://studio.support.brightcove.com/players/setting-player-update-mode-and-version.html">Setting the Player Update Mode and Version</a> document.</aside>

    <p>These steps allow you to manually set a player version.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>First, you will want to set the player to manually update. This will prevent a player version change to be overridden by a player update. To do this, go to Studio, <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module and in the <strong>Player Information</strong> section set the <strong>Update Mode</strong> to <strong>Manual.</strong>
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="studio ui set manual" src="/assets/images/troubleshooting/version-studio-ui-set-manual.png"></figure>
        Of course, save your changes.</li>
      <li>Now you will manually set the player version using the <strong>JSON Editor</strong> in the <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module. This is an example of a player configuration looks before any version change is made:
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="player configuration before change" src="/assets/images/troubleshooting/version-json-editor-before.png" /></figure>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">Note the <code translate="No">"locked": true</code> attribute is a result of step 1.</aside>
        In the <strong>JSON Editor</strong>, alter the <strong>version</strong> attribute to your desired version.
        <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="player configuration after change" src="/assets/images/troubleshooting/version-json-editor-after.png" /></figure>
        Be sure to save your changes then publish your player.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Don't forget once the issue is corrected to change your player back to be automatically updated.</p>
