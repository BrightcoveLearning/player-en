    <p>When integrating ad solutions with Brightcove Player, it is important to determine where an error occurs. Walk through the steps below to help determine where the issue is happening.</p>
    <p>There are two types of advertising. Choose the one that you are working with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#Client_side_advertising">Client-side advertising</a></li>
      <li><a href="#Server_side_advertising">Server-side advertising</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once you complete the steps below and you still can't resolve the issue, then please open a support ticket.</p>

    <p>If you are working with client-side ads such as IMA or FreeWheel, walk through these steps:</p>
    <h3>Check ad tag URL</h3>
    <p>First, you want to make sure your ad tag URL is setup correctly and functioning properly.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>Load the ad server URL (aka ad tag) in your browser to see if it looks ok.</li>
      <li>Google provides a set of <a href="https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/client-side/tags">sample ad tags</a>. Copy an ad tag URL and paste it into a browser to see the XML code.</li>
      <li>In a browser, navigate to the <a href="https://googleads.github.io/googleads-ima-html5/vsi/">IMA HTML5 Video Suite Inspector</a>.</li>
      <li>Enter your VAST or VMAP ad tag without header bidding into the text field.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Test Ad</strong>.</li>
      <li>You should see your ad playing in the <strong>Video Player</strong> area.</li>
      <li>If this does NOT work, here are some possible reasons:
        <ul>
          <li>An issue with your ad server</li>
          <li>Ad targeting parameters are too specific to return an ad</li>
          <li>You don't have any default/fallback ads when ad targeting fails to find an ad</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    </ol>

    <h2 id="Header_bidding">Header bidding</h2>
    <p>If you are having issues with ads loading while using header bidding, make sure you are performing tasks in the correct order to avoid race conditions. A good way to isolate an issue from a complexity of code is to start with a simple sample.</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Open the <a href="/advertising/jump-start-header-bidding-ad.html">Jump Start: Header Bidding Ad</a> document.</li>
      <li>Enter values for your Video Cloud Account ID and Video ID.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Build the Player</strong>.</li>
      <li>If this works, click <strong>Copy Code to Clipboard</strong>.</li>
      <li>Restructure your code to perform tasks in the following order: (you can paste the code from the Jump Start which is in this order)
        <ol>
          <li>Load prebid</li>
          <li>Load Brightcove Player</li>
          <li>Load IMA3 plugins</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Test the new structure of code.</li>
      <li>If this works, modify the code in your .js file in the same way.</li>
    </ol>
