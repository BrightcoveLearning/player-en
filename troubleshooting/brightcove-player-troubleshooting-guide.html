    <h2 id="Common_error_messages">Common error messages</h2>
    <p>Below is a list of error messages which you might receive when trying to play videos, along with suggested steps to try to fix the problem:</p>
    <h3>MEDIA_ERR_ABORTED</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Error code:</strong> 1</li>
      <li><strong>Headline:</strong> The video download was cancelled</li>
      <li><strong>Message:</strong> You aborted the media playback</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Possible cause</h4>
    <p>A somewhat generic browser error that indicates that something stopped the video download process in its tracks. This could be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>An issue with the computer, such as a crash or interruption to the network service</li>
      <li>A browser problem, or a configuration issue</li>
      <li>The browser is not supported, or currently lacks support for video</li>
      <li>A firewall, web proxy, or network issue is blocking the video download when the browser tries to play it</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to try</h4>
    <p>Here are some steps to try to fix the problem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refresh the page</li>
      <li>Try an alternative browser</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>MEDIA_ERR_NETWORK</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Error code:</strong> 2</li>
      <li><strong>Headline:</strong> The video connection was lost, please confirm you're connected to the internet</li>
      <li><strong>Message:</strong> A network error caused the media download to fail part-way</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Possible cause</h4>
    <p>Here are some possible causes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A firewall blocking the video data</li>
      <li>A web proxy interrupting the connection or filtering traffic</li>
      <li>Filtering software (such as Sophos, or Lightspeed Web Filter blocking content)</li>
      <li>A general network failure (for example, the internet connection to your home/school/personal computer fails)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to try</h4>
    <p>Here are some steps to try to fix the problem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check that the internet is working correctly on the affected machine</li>
      <li>Refresh the page, which can restart a connection that may have dropped</li>
      <li>Try another video. Does that work? If not, it suggests that content as a whole cannot be reached.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>MEDIA_ERR_DECODE</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Error code:</strong> 3</li>
      <li><strong>Headline:</strong> The video is bad or in a format that can't be played on your browser</li>
      <li><strong>Message:</strong> The media playback was aborted due to a corruption problem or because the media used features your browser did not support</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Possible cause</h4>
    <p>A browser being unable to play back the requested content. This can happen during playback, or more likely, at or towards the beginning.</p>
    <h4>Steps to try</h4>
    <p>Here are some steps to try to fix the problem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Refresh the page, which may re-download a piece of content that failed to play back due to a partial download on the first try.</li>
      <li>Update your browser to the latest version. Chrome and Firefox should prompt you with updates, but it is useful to check.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>MEDIA_ERR_SRC_NOT_SUPPORTED</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Error code:</strong> 4</li>
      <li><strong>Headline:</strong> This video is either unavailable or not supported in this browser</li>
      <li><strong>Message:</strong> The media could not be loaded, either because the server or network failed or because the format is not supported</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Possible cause</h4>
    <p>A browser being unable to play back the requested content due to it being unavailable, or cannot be played in this particular browser. It differs from error 3 in that playback fails before it begins, rather than during playback.</p>
    <h4>Steps to try</h4>
    <p>In most cases, both of these settings will be correct, but may have been specifically set by your IT team.</p>
    <h3>PLAYER_ERR_TIMEOUT</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Error code:</strong> -2</li>
      <li><strong>Headline:</strong> Could not download the video</li>
      <li><strong>Message:</strong> Could not download the video</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The player is unable to play back content / buffers for 45 seconds</p>
    <h4>Possible cause</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Insufficient bandwidth / network speed</li>
      <li>A firewall blocking the video data</li>
      <li>A web proxy interrupting the connection or filtering traffic</li>
      <li>Filtering software (such as Sophos, or Lightspeed Web Filter blocking content)</li>
      <li>A general network failure (for example, the internet connection to your home/school/personal computer fails)</li>
      <li>At times, it can be caused by player specific bugs</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps to try</h4>
    <p>Here are some steps to try to fix the problem:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Check that the internet is working correctly on the affected machine</li>
      <li>Refresh the page, which can restart a connection that may have dropped</li>
      <li>Try another video. Does that work? If not, it suggests that content as a whole cannot be reached.</li>
      <li>Does the issue always happen at the same point in time?</li>
    </ul>
