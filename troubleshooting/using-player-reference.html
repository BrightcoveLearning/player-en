  <h1>Using the Player Reference</h1>
  <summary>In this topic, you will learn how to use the Player Reference page that allows testing Brightcove Player with various configuration options and custom sources. During the testing, player information is available in the page, for instance the events that are dispatched by the player.</summary>
  <section id="Overview" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This page is intended for prospective and current customers to perform testing. The following are a few of the options you can test:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML Mode vs. Flash Mode</li>
      <li>Luna Skin vs. Graphite Skin</li>
      <li>Different video format types</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Player Reference page is located at <a href="http://players.brightcove.net/3303963094001/player-reference-app/index.html">http://players.brightcove.net/3303963094001/player-reference-app/index.html</a>.</p>

  <section id="Video_demonstration" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Video demonstration</h2>
    <p>A great way to learn about the player reference page is to watch this 4 1/2 minute video:</p>
    <iframe src="//players.brightcove.net/20318290001/E16-WGGOe_default/index.html?videoId=5168708306001" allowfullscreen="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" width="640" height="360"></iframe>
  </section>
  <section id="Supplying_a_video_source" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Supplying a video source</h2>
    <p>The first thing you will need to do is supply a video source for the player, or use one of the default videos provided. You paste in the URL, then click the options in the Configuration Buttonbar with which you wish to test. You must pre-select the options then click <strong>Load</strong>.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">Selecting options in the Configuration Buttonbar during playback has no effect. You must click the configuration buttons, then click <strong>Load</strong> again. Also, you need to manually choose the correct <strong>URL Content Type</strong> for the video supplied. If you choose the wrong type, either you will get an error or the video will not play.</aside>
    <p>If you wish, you can use a Video Cloud source for testing. Simply go to the <strong>MEDIA</strong> module in Studio, click on a video, then in the <strong>VIDEO FILES</strong> section right-click in the entry for the <strong>Format</strong> column, then choose <strong>Copy Link Address</strong>. You can then paste the copied link into the URL entry area.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Get the video source URL in Studio" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/troubleshooting/player-reference/get-video-source-url.png" /></figure>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">When supplying a DASH video source, you will be asked to also provide License Server URL. Note that at this time you cannot provide the entire <strong>keySystemsOptions</strong> object as <strong>Player Options</strong>.</aside>
  </section>
  <section id="section-name" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Supplying player options</h2>
    <p>One option on the Configuration Buttonbar that needs some explanation is the <strong>Player Options</strong> button.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Player options button" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/troubleshooting/player-reference/player-options-button.png" /></figure>
    <p>This button gives you a way to pass certain configuration options to the player using valid JSON formatted data. For instance, the following would provide a new poster and have the video loop on completion:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
{ "poster": "http://solutions.brightcove.com/fish_poster.png", "loop": true }</pre>
    <p>The <a href="/publish/available-options-advanced-page-embed-code.html">Available Options for the Advanced (in-page) Embed Code</a> document provides options you can use. Note that <code translate="No">width</code> and <code translate="No">height</code> options will not function correctly as player options as they are overridden by the page's configuration.</p>

  <section id="Viewing_displayed_data" class="bcls-section">
    <h2>Viewing displayed data</h2>
    <p>The reported data on the page is mostly easily interpreted, two areas will be explained a bit more here, those being the <strong>Bitrate Switching</strong> and <strong>Event Timeline</strong> sections.</p>
    <h3>Bitrate Switching</h3>
    <p>First, if you are viewing an MP4 video source you will not see any information in this section. For an MP4 the video source is sent and there is no further negotiation. For HLS, segments are periodically requested, so depending on bandwidth lower quality or higher quality segments can be requested. A line trending uphill (positive slope) in the graph would mean the available bitrate is increasing and better quality segments will be requested. Conversely, a line trending downhill (negative slope) in the graph would mean the available bitrate is decreasing and poorer quality segments will be requested.</p>
    <p>The lines in the graph correspond to what renditions are available for the video. When the plotted graph moves above a line the player will be requesting higher quality segments. The opposite is true when the plotted graph moves below a line. Note that you most likely would not see an immediate change in video quality when the plotter graph crosses a line. The requested segments would have to be sent based on the request, and when received appended to the segments currently in the buffer.</p>

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">Note: The graph above shows high and non-varying available bandwidth.</aside>
    <p>Sharp spikes in the plotted graph, as show below, would most likely trigger rendition changes.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Sharp spikes in graph" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/troubleshooting/player-reference/sharp-spikes.png" /></figure>
    <h3>Event Timeline</h3>
    <p>The event timeline will only display the events that have been dispatched. This screenshot shows an HLS video before it has started to play, and only the <code translate="No">progress</code> and <code translate="No">loadedmetadata</code> events have been dispatched.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Events at start" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/troubleshooting/player-reference/events-at-start.png" /></figure>
    <p>The following screenshot shows the same video after the video has begun playing, it has been paused and restarted, as well as a seek performed.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure"><img class="bcls-image" alt="Events after playing" src="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/player-development/playback/troubleshooting/player-reference/events-after-playing.png" /></figure>
