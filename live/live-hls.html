    <h2 id="knownissues">Known issues</h2>
    <p>The following are known issues with live HLS and the new player:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>iOS uses its native player to stream live HLS.</li>
      <li>On iOS, when you hit play on the live stream it goes into fullscreen. The new player cannot control that.</li>
      <li>Currently the new player does not detect if an HLS stream is live or not, hence the Live UI will not be applied on Android.</li>
    </ul>
