    <p>
      Google Chromecast is a device that you plug into your TV's HDMI port. Using your smartphone or computer as a remote control, you can use Chromecast to access video content. The Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove Player enables the player to cast video from your desktop or Android Chrome browser to the Chromecast device.
    </p>
    <p>The plugin supports all
      Video Cloud videos or external streams using HLS or DASH, including DRM-encrypted streams using Widevine. Advertising is supported through Video Cloud server-side ad insertion (SSAI). Client-side ads and playlists are not supported.</p>
    <p>To use the plugin follow these steps:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>
        Load the Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove Player (detailed below).
      </li>
      <li>
        Be sure the Chromecast device is on the same network as your device that will play the video.
      </li>
      <li>Start playing the video.</li>
      <li>Click the cast button and select your Chromecast device.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      The software behind Chromecast is comprised of the following components: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Sender application</strong>: This is any application that can initiate a cast session and communicate with a receiver. The sender application can be thought of as the "client side" portion of the Chromecast ecosystem.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove Player enables the sender app in Brightcove Player. You will learn about it in this topic.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Receiver application</strong>: This is a custom web application that is hosted on the public internet and runs on a Chromecast device. It handles communication between the sender app and the receiver device. It can be thought of as a single page HTML app with CSS and JavaScript assets.
        </p>
        <!-- <p>
 As a Brightcove Player customer, you do not need to work with the code and configuration of the receiver application. By default, this plugin uses the Brightcove receiver app.
 </p> -->
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"> For Chromecast to work with domain restricted players, you should whitelist the Chromecast receiver's domain, which is <code translate="No">players.brightcove.net</code>.

    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Requirements">Requirements</h2>
    <p>
      The following requirements are needed for the Chromecast plugin: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Brightcove Player v6.45.0 or newer
      </li>
      <li>
        Brightcove Chromecast plugin v2.0.0 or newer </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Devices</h3>
    <p>The following devices are supported:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Chromecast (3rd Generation)</li>
      <li>Chromecast Ultra</li>
      <li>Chromecast with Google TV (preliminary support)</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"> Older versions or combinations may continue working, but they are not supported.

  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="How_it_Works">How it Works</h2>
    <p>The current implementation (plugin/receiver version 2.x) uses the CAF (Cast Application Framework) API.</p>
    <p>
      When the Chromecast receiver plugin is added, the player will display a cast button in the player UI when there is an available Chromecast on the local network.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this button is clicked or tapped, a cast session is initiated with the current video that is loaded in the Brightcove Player. Here's how it works: </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>The plugin sends a set of parameters to the receiver.</li>
      <li>The receiver mirrors the sending player by loading it from Brightcove's CDN.</li>
      <li>Once loaded, the receiver-side player loads the video ID from the Playback API that was sent when the cast session began.</li>
      <li>Then, the receiver-side player begins playback at the playhead position of the sending player.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>This process is identical for non-Video Cloud sources except there is no Playback API request.</p>
    <h3>Analytics</h3>
    <p>Currently, from an analytics perspective, the cast session is treated as an entirely new playback session.</p>
    <p>From a UX perspective, the viewer will see their stream pause on the sender device and resume on the receiver.</p>
    <p>From a data perspective, because our metrics are anonymized by default, it is logged as a new viewer starting a new stream on a separate device. This is what actually happens.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Also note that Chromecast is categorized in the Analytics Module either as <code translate="no">android</code> or <code translate="no">linux</code>, depending on its user-agent and Chromecast version.</aside>

    <h2 id="Using_the_plugin">Using the plugin</h2>
    <p>
      The Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove Player is used like all other Brightcove Player plugins, that is you must load the plugin into the player.
    </p>
    <h3>Using Studio</h3>
    <p>The following steps detail using Studio to load the plugin.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"> When configured in Studio, the Player Management API will automatically select the best version combination for your player. If you get <strong>v1.x</strong> of the Chromecast plugin, you need to update your player!
    </aside>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>
        Open the <strong>PLAYERS</strong> module and either create a new player or locate the player to which you wish to add the plugin.
      </li>
      <li>Select the link for the player to open the player's properties.</li>
      <li>In the left navigation menu, select <strong>Plugins</strong>.</li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Next, select the <strong>Add a Plugin</strong> button, and then select <strong>Brightcove Plugin</strong>.
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
          Once the plugin is loaded, the video has started playing, and an available Chromecast device is in range, the cast button will appear in the player as shown here in this screenshot of a player: </p>

      <li>
        <p>Add an object to the <code translate="No">plugins</code> array</p>
        <p>
          Your code should look similar to this:

  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Configuration_options">Configuration options</h2>
    <p>No matter which method you choose to setup the Chromecast Plugin for Brightcove Player, you can pass options to modify plugin behavior. While setting these options is not necessary, additional customization is possible for advanced users. </p>
    <p>
      To pass options in code, you would use something similar to the following: </p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
 <code class="language-javascript" translate="No">videojs.getPlayer('myPlayerID').ready(function() { 
    var myPlayer = this;
    options = {};
    options.playerUrl = '//players.brightcove.net/1752604059001/default_default/index.min.js'; myPlayer.chromecastReceiver(options);
 });</code></pre>
    <h3>Advice</h3>
    <p>If your web player(s) contains a large number of plugins or custom scripts, you should consider creating a lightweight player specifically for Chromecast playback.</p>
    <p>Since the web player and its playback engine are somewhat resource intensive, running in a resource constrained environment (such as a Chromecast) with additional heavy scripts can negatively impact the user experience!</p>
    <h3>Options</h3>
    <p>
      The Chromecast plugin supports the following options: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code translate="No">options.appName </code><br /> <strong>Type</strong>: <code translate="No">string</code><br /> <strong>Default</strong>: 'Brightcove Chromecast CAF v2.0'
        <p>Override the default application name with your own custom name.</p>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip"> This option is available with the <a href="http://players.brightcove.net/release-notes/brightcove-player-chromecast-receiver/index.html">Chromecast Receiver plugin version 2.2.0</a> and newer.
        </aside>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code translate="No">options.playerUrl </code><br />
        <strong>Type</strong>: <code translate="No">string</code><br /> <strong>Default</strong>: ''
        <!-- <code translate="No">URL of current player</code> -->
        <!-- <p>
 When unspecified, this will point to the player that is casting your videos. Supplying this option will force the receiver to load a specific player rather than the player that is currently casting the video. This is useful when you want specific player code to only run on the Chromecast.
 </p> -->
        <p>By default, the sender-side player is mirrored on the receiver. You can use this option to provide a custom receiver-side Brightcove Player URL.</p>
        <p>Since this is a Brightcove player that is loaded on the receiver, you can customize, style and debug the player outside of Chromecast.</p>
        <p>Note that when using the <code>playerUrl</code> option, the players used as a sender and a receiver are different. If you are using domain restricted players, you need to use whitelisting. The whitelisting should be done for the <strong>sender</strong> player, NOT the player used as <strong>receiver</strong> (which is the player specified in this option).</p>
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"> This should be a URL to an <code translate="No">index.min.js</code> file on the Brightcove CDN </aside>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code translate="No">options.splashScreen </code><br /> <strong>Type</strong>: <code translate="No">string</code><br /> <strong>Default</strong>: ''
        <p>The splash screen that should be shown before a video and when videos are switching.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <code translate="No">options.authRequest </code><br /> <strong>Type</strong>: <code translate="No">string</code> or <code translate="No">object</code> or <code translate="No">function</code><br /> <strong>Default</strong>: {}<br /><br />
        <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information"> This is an uncommon option, so you probably won't need it!
        </aside>
        <p>You can use this option if you need the Chromecast to perform a request to get authorization to play content before a video is requested.</p>
        <p>You can also use this to get cookies, but your server will have to be set up to allow <code translate="No">players.brightcove.net</code> the ability to have cross domain cookies set if you are hosting your own content.</p>
        <h4>String usage</h4>
        <p>When <code translate="No">authRequest</code> is a string, an empty GET request will be made to that URL.</p>
        <h4>Object usage</h4>
        <p>When <code translate="No">authRequest</code> is an object, it can be used to specify certain request payload properties:</p>

    <h2 id="Limitations_and_known_issues">Limitations and known issues</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        HEVC/4K content is only supported on Chromecast Ultra devices and newer Chromecast with Google TV devices.
      </li>
      <li>Client-side advertising is not currently supported, but SSAI is supported!</li>
      <li>We have seen issues with seeking on the sender after a caption track has been selected and is displayed in the receiver.</li>
      <li>On Chromecast with Google TV devices, we have seen issues with the UI as well as playback issues when using captions.</li>
      <li>
        Google has stopped supporting non-secure origins (HTTP) with Chromecast, hence the plugin will not work in non-secure contexts. In these cases, the player's Chromecast button will not appear.
      </li>
      <li>
        Since the Chromecast Plugin relies on the browser's support for casting, it is only supported in the following OS/browser combinations: <ul>
          <li>Desktop/Chrome</li>
          <li>Android/Chrome</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Google does not support multiple instances of the Chromecast sender button on a single page. Possible workarounds would be to embed the Brightcove Player using the Standard (iframe) player implementation, or to dynamically instantiate and destroy players as needed. See the document
        <a href="/code-samples/brightcove-player-sample-loading-player-dynamically.html">Brightcove Player Sample: Loading the Player Dynamically</a>
        for information on the latter possibility.
      </li>
      <li>
        This plugin does not cast to Google Nest Hub. The plugin only supports actual Chromecast devices (i.e. Chromecast and Chromecast Ultra).
      </li>
      <li>Android WebView does not support casting with Chromecast. For <a href="https://issuetracker.google.com/u/1/issues/193047894?pli=1">more information</a> see Android's Issue Tracker.</li>
