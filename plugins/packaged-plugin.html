    <h2 id="What_are_packaged_plugins">What are Packaged Plugins?</h2>

    <p>Player features, including Advertising, Thumbnail Seeking, Playlists, and others, have historically been provided
      as plugins, and their management handled by a separate service called the <a
        href="https://apis.support.brightcove.com/player-management/guides/plugin-registry.html">Plugin Registry</a>.
      The Plugin Registry was initially designed to make managing player plugins efficient without user interaction.
      Still, over the years, it has led to confusion and mismatches in versions, leading to problems that could have
      been avoided.</p>
    <p>A common problem has been trying to use an old plugin version with a new player version (or vice versa), with the
      plugin relying on specific player functionality that may be different than expected or not present, leading to
      unexpected behavior or failures. We saw multiple examples of this with advertising as browsers moved to block
      autoplay with sound by default.</p>
    <p>By moving features into the player's core, we ensure that the code being used is the right version for the player
      because there is no longer a separate version. It's a part of the player that's been tested to function as
      expected.</p>

    <p>You shouldn't have to! The concept of Packaged Plugins is to ensure that the feature you are using is 100%
      compatible with your player version. Trying to use a different version goes against this.</p>

    <p>Registry plugin - notice that this JSON has no injected_versions, scripts, or stylesheets. The Registry just made

          "content": ""
        }
  }],
        </code>
          </pre>
    <p>Packaged Plugin version of the same feature:</p>
    <pre class="line-numbers">
        <code class="language-bash" translate="No">
          "plugins": [{

            }
      }],
            </code>

    <h2 id="Sideload">What if I must “sideload” a core plugin during player load time?</h2>

    <p>You should never need to do that, and we recommend against it. Brightcove's player management system is designed
      to compile all the features you need and deliver a working player with those features to your users.</p>
    <p>By way of example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Instead of sideloading the IMA3 plugin to support ads, if you need to deliver ads to your users, use a player
        with the IMA3 feature enabled.</li>
      <li>If you don't need ads in other situations, use a different player without the IMA3 feature enabled.</li>
      <li>To support both scenarios, use an IMA3-enabled player and programmatically configure ads only when needed.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="third_party">What about custom or third-party plugins?</h2>

    <p>We have not changed or removed any functionality for those. These changes only affect plugins managed by the
