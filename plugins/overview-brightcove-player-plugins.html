    <h2 id="Open_source_plugins">Open source plugins</h2>
    <p>The open source Video.js player, on which the Brightcove Player is based, has many plugins built for it. These plugins are compatible with the Brightcove Player as long as the version of the Video.js player is the same version on which the Brightcove Player is based. The Brightcove Player may be version-wise either ahead of, or behind, the open source Video.js player. The link to the Video.js Plugins page is <a href="https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Plugins">https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Plugins</a>.</p>
    <p>Also available are Brightcove Player specific open source plugins. As examples are plugins for Conviva and Nielsen analytics. Note that Brightcove does not provide support for, or document, these plugins. Customers should contact their account managers at Conviva/Nielsen for details and access.</p>
    <p>Available from <a href="https://moat.com/analytics">Moat</a>, a company which provides publishers a simple way to measure and report on the viewability of ads played back, is a plugin that works with Brightcove Player. To gain access to Moat’s plugin for the Brightcove Player, customers should reach out to their Moat account manager.</p>
