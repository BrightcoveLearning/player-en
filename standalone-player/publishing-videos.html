      <p>The source that is selected for playback is determined by the video order you've configured and the capabilities of the browser and device on which the player is loaded. If you haven't altered the defaults, and HLS is supported natively, the player will check if any of the sources point to HLS videos and select the first one it finds. If HLS is not supported natively or no HLS video sources have been specified, HTML playback will be attempted next. As previously, the first playable source will be selected. If the first two attempts to play the video fail, Flash fallback will be tried.</p>

      <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--tip">Note: Source selection is different from rendition selection. Rendition selection is a process of selecting a particular variant of a video when it is available in multiple formats or quality levels that are all playable. Source selection isn't that smart, it just starts using the first video that is compatible with the player. The Brightcove player does rendition selection during playback, automatically adjusting the quality level based on bandwidth information detected by the player. It only does so, however, within an HLS source. It does not support doing rendition selection among multiple bitrate MP4 files, for instance.
